            <h2>My Artistic Journey</h2>
            <p>Art has always been more than a hobby for me—it's a form of self-expression. From experimenting with vibrant watercolors to perfecting the delicate curves of calligraphy, I've dedicated countless hours to mastering my craft. Nature, literature, and fine details are my primary sources of inspiration.</p>
